Like any social media platform, users have the ability to create posts on their personal timeline, follow other users, join group communities, and create posts within group communities.

For example, a user can follow their friends and other users, like a seasoned investor who specializes in owning long-term rental properties. A user can also join different group communities, like a “Dallas Fort Worth Investors” community where investors discuss trends and opportunities happening in the greater DFW market.
